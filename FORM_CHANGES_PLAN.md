   - If removing from form, where does it go?
   - Still required for submission?

3. **Medical Conditions:**
   - What time period for hospitalization? (1/6/12 months)
   - What should the conditions dropdown include?

4. **Medications:**
   - Is dropdown selection realistic/necessary?
   - What medication database to use?
   - How complex should this be?

5. **Content Decisions:**
   - Keep past medications field?
   - Keep "Top 3 goals" field?
   - Where to place agreement links?

6. **Primary Care Physician:**

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Approach A: Incremental (Recommended)
- Start with Phase 1 (quick wins)
- Get feedback after each phase
- Defer complex changes (medications dropdown) until absolutely needed

### Approach B: All at Once
- Risk: Many breaking changes at once
- Not recommended without comprehensive testing plan

### Approach C: Hybrid
- Do Phases 1 & 2 immediately (low risk, clear requirements)
- Get stakeholder decisions on Phase 3 & 4 items
- Implement Phase 3 & 4 after clarification
