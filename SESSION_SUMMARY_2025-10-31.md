# Session Summary - October 31, 2025

## 🎉 Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Staging Environment - Fully Deployed
- **URL:** https://onboarding-staging.override.health
- **Status:** Live and operational
- **Infrastructure:** EC2 t3.micro, RDS PostgreSQL, SSL certificate, nginx + PM2
- **Deployment Time:** Completed in single session

### 2. ✅ CI/CD - Fully Operational
- **Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Workflows Created:**
  - `test.yml` - Runs on every push/PR (validates code, runs tests, builds)
  - `deploy-staging.yml` - Auto-deploys to staging on push to main
- **Secrets Configured:**
  - `STAGING_SSH_KEY` - SSH access to staging server
  - `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` - Mapbox API token for builds
- **Test Results:** 3 successful automated deployments
- **Average Deploy Time:** 40-45 seconds

### 3. ✅ Delete Feature Added
- **Backend:** `DELETE /api/intake/{intake_id}` endpoint
- **Frontend:** Delete button (red) next to View button on admin dashboard
- **Features:**
  - Confirmation dialog with patient name
  - Works for both drafts and completed intakes
  - Auto-refreshes list after deletion
  - Success/error messaging
- **Deployed:** Via automated CI/CD

### 4. ✅ Environment Configuration Fixed
- **Problem:** React app was hardcoded to localhost, causing CORS errors
- **Solution:**
  - Use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable
  - CI/CD workflow passes correct URL during build
  - Maintains localhost default for local development
- **Result:** No more CORS errors on staging

### 5. ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
- **Created:**
  - `STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` (11 KB) - Complete deployment record
  - `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (17 KB) - Ready-to-execute production guide
  - `CI_CD_SETUP.md` (9 KB) - CI/CD documentation and setup
  - `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (8 KB) - One-page command reference
- **Updated:**
  - `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Current status and progress
  - `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Updated with decisions made

## 🚀 How CI/CD Works Now

### Automatic Deployment Flow:
```
Code Change → git commit → git push origin main
    ↓
GitHub detects push to main
    ↓
Triggers 2 workflows in parallel:
    ├─ Test & Build (validates code)
    └─ Deploy to Staging (deploys app)
    ↓
Deploy workflow:
    ├─ Builds React app with staging config
    ├─ SSHs to staging server
    ├─ Syncs frontend dist/ folder
    ├─ Syncs backend Python code
    ├─ Installs dependencies
    ├─ Restarts backend with PM2
    └─ Runs health checks
    ↓
Deployment complete (~40-45 seconds)
    ↓
Site updated at https://onboarding-staging.override.health
```

**No manual intervention needed!**

   ```

2. **AdminDashboard.jsx Updated:**
   - Added `handleDeleteIntake()` function (lines 56-80)
   - Added delete button with confirmation (lines 258-264)
   - Auto-refresh after deletion

### CI/CD Workflow Changes:

   - No more manual SSH commands
   - Automatic testing catches issues early

2. **Environment variables are essential**
   - Same code works in dev, staging, and production
   - No hardcoded URLs
   - Build-time configuration

3. **Documentation is critical**
   - Comprehensive docs saved time
