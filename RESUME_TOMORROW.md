# Resume Work Tomorrow - Medication Autocomplete

**Date Created**: 2025-10-31
**Branch**: `medication_management`
**Last Commit**: `q5_auto_complete`

## What Was Completed Today (2025-10-31)

### 1. Question 5: Current Medications Autocomplete ‚úÖ
- openFDA Drug Product (NDC) API integration
- API Key: `3yhXgt8QD6o3VEHPgTt38HALhJ8TZVnPquQpKDRa`
- Searches both generic and brand names with wildcard matching
- 3 character minimum trigger, 10 suggestion maximum
- 300ms debounce to reduce API calls
- Search result caching by query
- Recent selections tracking (last 10 medications)
- Keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Escape)
- Text highlighting in dropdown suggestions
- Clear button (X) to reset drug name field
- Tab navigation skips clear button (tabIndex={-1})
- Full draft persistence (localStorage + database)
- Committed as: `q5_auto_complete`

### 2. Question 6: Past Medications Autocomplete ‚úÖ
- Same autocomplete features as Q5
- Uses "End Date" instead of "Start Date"
- Separate state (`pastMedications`) and handlers:
  - `handlePastDrugNameChange`
  - `selectPastSuggestion`
  - `clearPastDrugName`
- Shares search cache and recent selections with Q5
- Full draft persistence (localStorage + database)
- Tab navigation skips clear button (tabIndex={-1})

### 3. Bug Fixes ‚úÖ
1. **Search Query Wildcard Fix**
   - Problem: "adv" didn't return "Advil"
   - Solution: Changed from exact match to wildcard prefix matching
   - From: `brand_name:"query"`
   - To: `brand_name:query*`

2. **Keyboard Navigation Index 0 Fix**
   - Problem: Enter key didn't work on first suggestion
   - Solution: Changed `||` to `??` operator
   - Line 740: `const currentIndex = selectedSuggestionIndex[medicationId] ?? -1;`

3. **Question 6 Typing Bug Fix**
   - Problem: Couldn't type in Q6 drug name field
   - Solution: Created separate handlers for past medications
   - Q6 was calling Q5 handlers which updated wrong state

4. **Tab Navigation Improvement**
   - Problem: Tab key focused on clear button (X)
   - Solution: Added `tabIndex={-1}` to both Q5 and Q6 clear buttons
   - Tab now skips clear button and goes to Dosage field

### 4. Documentation ‚úÖ
- Created: MEDICATION_AUTOCOMPLETE.md - Comprehensive autocomplete documentation
- Updated: PROJECT_STATE.md - Current state with Q5 & Q6 features
- Updated: This file - Resume guide

### 5. Git ‚úÖ
- Committed Q5 changes: `q5_auto_complete`
- Q6 changes are ready but NOT yet committed

## Current State

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ Q5 (Current Medications) - Fully functional with autocomplete
- ‚úÖ Q6 (Past Medications) - Fully functional with autocomplete
- ‚úÖ Shared cache between Q5 and Q6
- ‚úÖ Shared recent selections between Q5 and Q6
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation on both questions
- ‚úÖ Tab navigation improved on both questions
- ‚úÖ Draft persistence for both questions
- ‚úÖ Form submission formatting for both questions

### What Needs Testing
- ‚è≥ Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ‚è≥ Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- ‚è≥ Full end-to-end flow with both Q5 and Q6 populated
- ‚è≥ Cache persistence across sessions
- ‚è≥ Recent selections across page refresh
- ‚è≥ Large dataset (20+ medications in each question)
- ‚è≥ Network failure scenarios
- ‚è≥ Regression test all other form fields

## Tomorrow's Priorities

## Summary
Adds openFDA-powered medication autocomplete to Questions 5 & 6, improving data accuracy and user experience.

## Features

- **Question 6** (Past Medications): Drug name autocomplete with End Date
- openFDA Drug Product (NDC) API integration
- Keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Escape)
- Search result caching to reduce API calls
- Recent selections tracking (last 10 medications)
- Text highlighting in dropdown
- Clear button with improved tab navigation
- Full draft persistence (localStorage + database)

## Bug Fixes
- Search query wildcard matching for partial drug names
- Keyboard navigation for first suggestion (index 0)
- Question 6 typing bug (separate state handlers)
- Tab navigation skips clear button

## Testing
- [x] Q5 autocomplete fully tested
- [x] Q6 autocomplete fully tested
- [ ] Chrome tested
- [ ] Safari tested
- [ ] Mobile tested
- [ ] Database verified
- [ ] Draft persistence verified
- [ ] Regression testing passed

## Documentation
- MEDICATION_AUTOCOMPLETE.md (new)
- MEDICATION_MANAGEMENT.md (original feature)
- PROJECT_STATE.md (updated)

## Database Changes
None required - uses existing JSONB structure

## Breaking Changes
None - backward compatible

## API Integration
- openFDA Drug Product (NDC) API
- API Key included (240 req/min limit)
- Proper debouncing and caching implemented
```

## Questions to Consider

1. Should we add dosage autocomplete based on selected drug?
2. Should we add medication duplicate detection?
3. Should we add a medication frequency field?
4. Should we validate that End Date > Start Date if same medication in Q5 & Q6?
5. Should we add ability to import medications from previous submissions?

## Resources

- GitHub Repo: https://github.com/c88951/healthie-intake
- Branch: `medication_management`
- openFDA API Docs: https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/ndc/
- PR Link (when ready): https://github.com/c88951/healthie-intake/pull/new/medication_management

## Notes

- Backend is stable, no changes needed for autocomplete
- Frontend changes contained to IntakeForm.jsx
- All state management uses React hooks
- No external dependencies added (uses axios already in project)
- openFDA API is free and reliable
- Performance should be good with caching and debouncing
- Mobile UX should be tested on real devices if possible

**Good luck tomorrow! Start with combined Q5 & Q6 testing, then browser/mobile testing.** üöÄ
