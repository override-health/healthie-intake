# Session Progress - 2025-10-16

## Current State: WORKING WITHOUT BMI
**Git Commit:** `44acff5 - working without BMI`

## What's Working ✅

### 1. Canvas-Based Signature Pad
- **Status:** FULLY WORKING
- **Implementation:**
  - Replaced text input signature with HTML5 canvas-based signature pad
  - Using signature_pad library v4.1.7 from CDN
  - JavaScript helper at `HealthieIntake.UI/wwwroot/js/signature-pad.js`
  - Styled to match Override Health brand (green/navy theme)
  - Canvas size: 500x200px

- **Bug Fixed:** Signature duplication issue
  - **Problem:** Signatures were duplicating with each stroke drawn
  - **Root Cause:** `InitializeSignaturePad` was loading saved signatures on every Blazor re-render
  - **Solution:** Added `HashSet<string> initializedSignaturePads` to track which pads have been initialized, preventing reload during drawing
  - **Code Location:** `IntakeForm.razor:1270-1303`

### 2. Height Field Submission
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Implementation:** Sending only total inches (e.g., "76") to `bmiModuleId`
- **User Confirmation:** "and that worked. whatever the hell you did please remember it"
- **Critical Note:** User's explicit instruction: "forget about BMI for now just for the love of god get the height string correctly send over to healthie BMI should not be on your mind until I tell you it is"

### 3. Form Progress Saving
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Implementation:** Multi-step form with auto-save using browser localStorage

### 4. Mapbox Address Autocomplete
- **Status:** WORKING
- **Implementation:** Step 2 address field with geocoding

## Known Issues ⚠️

### 1. Weight Field Submission
- **Status:** NOT WORKING - DEFERRED
- **Problem:** Weight field still not coming over to Healthie
- **User Note:** "the weight still did not come over lets take a break form this"
- **Next Steps:** Resume investigation after break

### 2. BMI Field
- **Status:** EXPLICITLY DEFERRED
- **User Instruction:** "BMI should not be on your mind until I tell you it is"
- **DO NOT WORK ON THIS** until user explicitly requests it

## Key Files Modified

1. **HealthieIntake.UI/Pages/IntakeForm.razor**
   - Added `HashSet<string> initializedSignaturePads` (line 1271)
   - Modified `InitializeSignaturePad` method (lines 1274-1303)
   - Added `CaptureAllSignatures` method (lines 1342-1353)
   - Updated `HandleSubmit` to call `CaptureAllSignatures()` (line 768)
   - Removed event handlers from canvas rendering (lines 408-414)

2. **HealthieIntake.UI/wwwroot/js/signature-pad.js** (NEW FILE)
   - JavaScript wrapper for signature_pad library
   - Methods: initialize, clear, isEmpty, getDataURL, setDataURL, destroy

3. **HealthieIntake.UI/wwwroot/css/override-brand.css**
   - Added signature canvas styling (lines 176-201)
   - Override Health brand colors: Navy (#050038), Green (#1CB783)

4. **HealthieIntake.UI/wwwroot/index.html**
   - Added signature_pad CDN library (line 41)
   - Added custom signature-pad.js script (line 42)

## Important Context Documents

1. **CODE_REVIEW_MODE.md** - CRITICAL OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
   - Created after 10+ failed attempts to fix "Patient Agreement" header issue
   - Root cause was case sensitivity assumption (checking "PATIENT AGREEMENT" vs actual "Patient Agreement")
   - Mandatory rules:
     - Always read code first before making changes
     - Always verify data formats (case, whitespace, etc.)
     - Always debug first fix before adding complexity
     - Always use case-insensitive comparison where appropriate
     - Use Grep with case-insensitive search to find all variations

2. **RESTART_REMINDER.md**
   - Always restart application after code changes

3. **ADDRESS_FIELD_FIX_MEMORY.md**
   - Critical bug fixes to remember for address field

## Development Environment

- **Working Directory:** `/Users/corey/source/repos/healthie-intake`
- **Git Status:** Committed, clean working tree
- **UI Application:** http://localhost:5046
- **API Application:** http://localhost:5095
- **Platform:** macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)

## How to Resume Development

1. **Start from this commit:**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --format='%h - %s'
   # Shows: 44acff5 - working without BMI
   ```

2. **If BMI changes break things, revert with:**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard 44acff5
   ```

3. **Next Task:** Fix weight field submission to Healthie
   - Problem: Weight value not coming through to Healthie
   - Status: Deferred, ready to investigate after break

4. **Blocked Task:** BMI field
   - DO NOT WORK ON until user explicitly requests
   - User said: "BMI should not be on your mind until I tell you it is"

## User Feedback Indicators

**Positive Signs:**
- "that fixed it"
- "and that worked. whatever the hell you did please remember it"

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- "you suck"
- "why is this so hard for you?"
- "I'll try to figure it out myself"
- "you know the definition of insanity right?"
- "this took way too long"

When these appear: STOP, read actual code, verify data, debug assumptions (see CODE_REVIEW_MODE.md)

## Application Architecture

### Frontend (Blazor WebAssembly)
- **Path:** `HealthieIntake.UI/`
- **Main Component:** `Pages/IntakeForm.razor`
- **JavaScript Interop:** `wwwroot/js/`
- **Styling:** `wwwroot/css/override-brand.css` (Override Health brand)

### Backend (ASP.NET Core API)
- **Path:** `HealthieIntake.Api/`
- **Integration:** Healthie GraphQL API
- **Custom Module Forms:** Step-based intake form submission

### Key Libraries
- **signature_pad:** v4.1.7 (Canvas-based signature capture)
- **Mapbox GL JS:** v3.0.1 (Address autocomplete with geocoding)

## Critical Reminders

1. **Always restart after code changes** (see RESTART_REMINDER.md)
2. **Read code before making changes** (see CODE_REVIEW_MODE.md)
3. **Verify data formats** - Don't assume case, whitespace, or structure
4. **Height field works** - Remember the fix that sends total inches to bmiModuleId
5. **Signature pad fixed** - Used HashSet to prevent reload during drawing
6. **Weight field broken** - Next task to investigate
7. **BMI field off-limits** - Until user says otherwise
