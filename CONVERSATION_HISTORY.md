---

### 3. Form Modifications - Question 9

**User Request:** Change question 9 label from "Do you have any history of physical or psychological trauma?" to "Do you engage in regular physical activity outside of your normal daily tasks?"

**Implementation:**
- File: `IntakeForm.jsx` line 1082
- Changed label text
- Converted from textarea to Yes/No radio buttons
- Added state: `engagesInPhysicalActivity`

---

### 4. Form Modifications - Question 10 (Physical Activity Description)

**Implementation:**
- Renumbered question 10 to 9b
- Added conditional rendering: `engagesInPhysicalActivity === 'Yes'`
- Renumbered all subsequent questions
- Maintained question counter logic

**Git Commit:** "dynamic_ui_to_q10"

---

### 6. Form Modifications - Question 11 Updates

**User Request:**

**Implementation:**
- Renumbered to 12b
- Added to `subQuestionIds` array
- Automatic renumbering of subsequent questions

---

### 8. Form Modifications - 12b Conditional Logic

- Show if any substance use checkboxes selected
- HIDE if "None of the above" is the only selection
- SHOW if other checkboxes selected (with or without "None of the above")

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Check checkbox selections
if (selections.size === 0) return null;
if (selections.size === 1 && selections.has('None of the above')) return null;
// Otherwise show 12b
```

### 9. Form Modifications - Question 14 → Sub-question 13b

**User Request:** Make question 14 (unhealthy relationship details, ID 19056496) a sub-question 13b, only show when "Yes" selected for question 13

**Implementation:**
- Renumbered to 13b
- Added conditional: `getFormAnswer(unhealthyRelationshipModule.id) === 'Yes'`
- Added to `subQuestionIds` array
- Renumbered subsequent questions

---

### 10. Form Modifications - Remove Question 15

**User Request:** "remove question 15 on this step altogether"

### 12. Architectural Analysis - Initial Request

**User Request:** "I would like to hear a grand plan to completely rearchitect this system so that the UI, DTO and DAO objects in the UI and then in the Python API are more clean and decoupled from direct interaction with Healthie EMR."

**Key Requirements:**
- Clean object model
- Decouple from Healthie EMR
- New DTO/DAO patterns
- Domain-driven design
- Maintain data integrity

**Comprehensive Analysis Provided:**
- 27,000+ word architectural analysis
- Current architecture and data flows
- All form fields and Healthie mappings
- Technical debt assessment
- Proposed three-layer architecture:
  1. Presentation Layer (React UI)
  2. Application Layer (Python API with domain models)
  3. Data Layer (PostgreSQL + Healthie sync)

**Proposed Domain Models:**
- `PatientIntake` (aggregate root)
- `PersonalInformation`
- `MedicalHistory`
- `CurrentTreatment`
- `LifestyleFactors`
- `MentalHealthHistory`

**Execution Plan:**
- Timeline: 10-11 weeks
- Phased approach with parallel work streams
- Database schema design
- Repository pattern implementation
- Service layer with sync logic
- API endpoint updates
- React UI refactoring

---

### 13. Simplified Architecture - Remove Healthie from Intake

**User Request:** "what if we remove healthie from consideration altogether and focus on getting everything into postgresql for now and later I will create an AWS lambda that will sync the data with healthie"

**Key Changes:**
- PostgreSQL-first approach
- NO Healthie coupling in intake system
- Clean domain models without sync tracking
- Pure CRUD API
- AWS Lambda handles Healthie sync separately (future work)

**Benefits:**
- 60% faster timeline: 4-5 weeks vs 10-11 weeks
- 50% less code to write
- Complete separation of concerns
- Simpler domain models
- No sync complexity

**Revised Architecture:**
```
React UI → Python API → PostgreSQL
                     ↓
                AWS Lambda (future) → Healthie EMR
```

### 14. MongoDB vs PostgreSQL Evaluation

**User Request:** "if the form could change over time how would you change the plan if we used mongo atlas instead of postgresql and can you tell me the pros and cons of postgresql vs mongo atlas"

**Key Concerns:**
- Form will evolve over time (new questions, changed questions)
- Schema flexibility needed
- Need to support multiple form versions

**Analysis Provided:**

#### PostgreSQL Pros:
- ACID transactions
- Strong data integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Complex queries and JOINs
- Mature ecosystem
- Strong schema validation

#### PostgreSQL Cons:
- Requires schema migrations for every form change
- Can be rigid for evolving schemas
- Downtime risk during migrations
- Must migrate existing rows when adding fields

#### MongoDB Atlas Pros:
- Zero-downtime schema changes
- Old and new documents coexist naturally
- No migration scripts needed
- Perfect for A/B testing form variations
- Document model matches domain objects
- Fully managed service (backups, scaling, monitoring)
- Rapid prototyping
- Faster development iteration

#### MongoDB Atlas Cons:
- Eventual consistency
- No foreign keys
- Can lead to data inconsistency
- Validation must be done at application level
- Must handle multiple schema versions in queries
- Vendor lock-in
- Can get expensive at scale

**RECOMMENDATION: MongoDB Atlas**

**Reasons:**
1. Schema evolution without pain
2. Perfect impedance match (48 state variables → single document)
3. Form versioning natural
4. AWS Lambda friendly
5. Faster development (no migration slowdowns)
6. Managed service (less operational burden)

**Updated Timeline with MongoDB Atlas: 3-4 weeks**

- **6b**: Procedures other (conditional)
- **7b**: Other treatment strategies (conditional)
- **9b**: Physical activity description (shows if Yes to question 9)
- **11b**: Family history details (shows if "Other" selected)
- **12b**: Substance use details (shows if any checkbox selected, except "None of the above" alone)
- **13b**: Unhealthy relationship details (shows if Yes to question 13)

### State Variables (48+)
- Patient demographics (name, email, DOB, etc.)
- Medical history
- Current medications
- Treatment history
- Lifestyle factors
- Mental health history
- Physical activity (new)
- Physical activity description (new)

## Architecture Decisions

### Current (Tightly Coupled)
```
React UI (48 useState) → Python API → Healthie GraphQL API
```

### Proposed (Decoupled)
```
React UI → Python API → MongoDB Atlas
                              ↓
                        (Future) AWS Lambda → Healthie EMR
```

### Why Decouple?
1. Form ownership and control
2. Schema flexibility for evolving forms
3. Performance improvements
4. Reduced Healthie API dependency
5. Easier testing and development
6. Data portability
7. Cost reduction

---

## Questions Remaining

1. **Timeline**: User wants faster than 3-4 weeks - need to clarify requirements
2. **Patient Identification**: How to generate patient IDs?
3. **Form Versioning**: Strategy for handling multiple form versions?
4. **Data Retention**: How long to keep submissions before Healthie sync?
5. **Security**: Authentication and authorization approach?
6. **Deployment**: AWS? Docker? Serverless?
